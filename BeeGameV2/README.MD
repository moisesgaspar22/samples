## Lets make the Bee Game scalable using dependency injection containers

This is the same version of the game but this time I'm using Pimple, a simple PHP Dependency Injection Container

[More about it here](https://pimple.symfony.com/)

This is just a proof of concept 

## Instalation
copy the beegame folder to the desired location into your pc
Head inside the beegame folder and run
```shelscript
composer install
```

Then
```shelscript
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 index.php
```

Head to you browser and type into the url
```shelscript
localhost:8080
```

## Objective
[Same as the original](https://github.com/moisesgaspar22/samples/edit/master/beegame/README.md)
