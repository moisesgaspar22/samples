# MG Code Samples
Hi there,

This is jus a small sample of some code to demonstrate some concepts.

Inside this repository you will find 3 projects:
* 🏦 - A CLI php bank application
* 🐝 - A php browser simple Bee game
* 🧪 A phpunit test app scenario to demonstrate some unit and integration test concepts/implementation

Please note that this is just the tip of the iceberg...❄️

I'm not explaining design patterns like singletons or factories or even architectural choices, if you're looking at this then you know what your looking for and you will recognize it once you see it 🙂

You can find me 📧 moisesgaspar22@gmail.com

Enjoy!
